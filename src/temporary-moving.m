//This file is created by Parker and Semeraro.
//It contains programs designed to calculate with fusion systems.  
//It also has programs to find all saturated fusion systems on 
//a given p-group with trivial $p$-core and $p$-quotient. 
//It can be easilly modified to find all saturated fusion systems if 
//so desired. Details can be found in  
//``Algorithms for fusion systems with applications 
//to $p$-groups of small order" by Parker and  Semeraro
//It also contains other functions that we found useful.
//It works on Magma V2.25-4.  Load the file by Attach("FusionSystems.m");
